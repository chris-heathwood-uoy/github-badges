# github-badges
Test using the wiki to store the test badges and possibly coverage reports.

These badges are stored on the wiki, the github action :

* Runs the tests (which creates the badges as well)
* Uploads them to the wiki

That way they are stored somewhere that is not the main repository so we don't need to keep syncing back to the main repo.
