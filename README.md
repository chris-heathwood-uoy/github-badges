# github-badges
Test using the wiki to store the test badges and possibly coverage reports.

![Branch Coverage]( https://github.com/chris-heathwood-uoy/github-badges/wiki/badge-branches.svg) ![Function Coverage]( https://github.com/chris-heathwood-uoy/github-badges/wiki/badge-functions.svg) ![Lines Coverage]( https://github.com/chris-heathwood-uoy/github-badges/wiki/badge-lines.svg) ![Statements Coverage]( https://github.com/chris-heathwood-uoy/github-badges/wiki/badge-statements.svg).

These badges are stored on the wiki, the github action :

* Runs the tests (which creates the badges as well)
* Uploads them to the wiki

That way they are stored somewhere that is not the main repository so we don't need to keep syncing back to the main repo.
